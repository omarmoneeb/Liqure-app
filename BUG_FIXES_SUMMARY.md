# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå CabinetRepository: Date Format Exception
**Problem**: `FormatException: Invalid date format` when parsing dates from PocketBase
**Root Cause**: `DateTime.parse()` was failing on invalid or empty date strings from server
**Solution**: Added robust date parsing with fallback handling in `CabinetItemModel.fromPocketBase()`
- Added `_parseDateTime()` helper method with multiple format support
- Graceful fallback to `DateTime.now()` for required fields
- Proper null handling for optional date fields

### 2. ‚ùå OfflineRatingsRepository: Null to Double Cast Error
**Problem**: `type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'double'` in rating calculations
**Root Cause**: Database queries returning `null` for average ratings were being cast to `double`
**Solution**: Enhanced null handling in `OfflineRatingsRepository`
- Added explicit null checks in `getDrinkAverageRating()`
- Return safe defaults instead of throwing exceptions
- Fixed all rating calculation methods to handle null values

### 3. üîå Server Connectivity Issues on Personal Device
**Problem**: App couldn't connect to server when running on physical device
**Root Cause**: Using `localhost:8090` which doesn't work on physical devices
**Solution**: Enhanced app configuration for device development
- Added `DEV_IP` environment variable support
- Improved error messages with helpful tips
- Added automatic IP detection script (`setup_dev_env.sh`)

### 4. üí• App Crash When Unplugged from Laptop
**Problem**: App crashed when losing connection to development server
**Root Cause**: Poor error handling in auth check and server connectivity
**Solution**: Improved offline error handling
- Enhanced auth status check to fail gracefully
- Added timeout handling in server reachability checks
- Better connection error handling in PocketBase client
- Offline-first architecture already in place, just needed better error handling

## Files Modified

### Core Configuration
- `app/lib/core/config/app_config.dart` - Added DEV_IP support
- `app/lib/core/network/pocketbase_client.dart` - Enhanced error handling
- `app/.env.example` - Added DEV_IP documentation

### Data Models
- `app/lib/features/inventory/data/models/cabinet_item_model.dart` - Fixed date parsing
- `app/lib/core/database/local/repositories/offline_ratings_repository.dart` - Fixed null handling

### Authentication
- `app/lib/features/auth/presentation/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Enhanced offline error handling

### Setup Tools
- `app/setup_dev_env.sh` - New script for automatic environment setup

## How to Use

### For Physical Device Testing
1. Run the setup script: `./app/setup_dev_env.sh`
2. Make sure PocketBase is running on your laptop
3. Connect your device to the same WiFi network
4. Build and run the app

### For Emulator/Simulator
1. No changes needed - localhost will work automatically
2. Make sure PocketBase is running: `pb serve`

## Technical Improvements

1. **Robust Date Parsing**: Handles various date formats and invalid data
2. **Null Safety**: Proper handling of nullable database results
3. **Offline-First**: App works without server connection
4. **Better Error Messages**: Helpful debug information for developers
5. **Auto-Configuration**: Script automatically detects IP for device development

## Testing

All fixes have been tested for:
- ‚úÖ Invalid date formats from server
- ‚úÖ Null database results  
- ‚úÖ Offline functionality
- ‚úÖ Device connectivity
- ‚úÖ Error recovery

The app should now run smoothly on both emulators and physical devices, with proper offline support and graceful error handling.
